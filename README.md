# arduino-incubator
An arduino program written to use a bunch of sensors and control a bunch of heat to hatch a bunch of birds

The main program file `main.cpp` has been written in a way which should make it as simple as possible to figure out how to connect the required electronics to the arduino board.

That concludes the most useful readme i ever wrote.
